# Accountant Rewards Management Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The "Grant Rewards" (منح المكافآت) button in the Accountant Dashboard's Workers tab was incorrectly navigating to the Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`), breaking the user flow and taking accountants outside their designated interface.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Accountant-Specific Rewards Management Screen
**File:** `lib/screens/accountant/accountant_rewards_management_screen.dart`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Dedicated accountant interface** - Maintains accountant dashboard styling and context
- ✅ **Same functionality as admin version** - Full rewards management capabilities
- ✅ **Proper back navigation** - Returns to accountant dashboard, not admin interface
- ✅ **Dark theme consistency** - Matches accountant dashboard design (Colors.grey.shade900)
- ✅ **Role-based access** - Uses accountant permissions, not admin permissions
- ✅ **Arabic RTL support** - Proper Arabic text alignment and Cairo font family

**Key Components:**
- Quick reward granting section with worker dropdown
- Summary cards showing total rewards, worker count, and active rewards
- Workers section with individual worker cards and balance information
- Recent rewards history with filtering options
- Reward dialog for granting new rewards
- Account clearing functionality for worker balance management

### 2. Fixed Navigation Logic
**File:** `lib/screens/accountant/accountant_dashboard.dart`

**Changes:**
- ✅ **Removed incorrect admin navigation** - No longer redirects to `/admin/dashboard`
- ✅ **Added proper accountant navigation** - Uses `MaterialPageRoute` to `AccountantRewardsManagementScreen`
- ✅ **Added import statement** - Imports the new accountant rewards screen
- ✅ **Maintained button styling** - Keeps existing professional button design

**Before:**
```dart
onPressed: () {
  // Navigate to admin rewards management
  Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/admin/dashboard');
},
```

**After:**
```dart
onPressed: () {
  // Navigate to accountant rewards management screen
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => const AccountantRewardsManagementScreen(),
    ),
  );
},
```

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Reward Balances:** Displays current balance, total earned, and reward count
- **Real-time Updates:** Refreshes data after reward operations
- **Filtering Options:** All workers, individual worker, or recent rewards
- **Search Functionality:** Dropdown selection for quick worker access

### Security & Permissions
- **Role-based Access:** Uses accountant role permissions
- **RLS Compliance:** Works with existing Row Level Security policies
- **Data Validation:** Validates reward amounts and descriptions
- **Error Boundaries:** Graceful error handling for failed operations

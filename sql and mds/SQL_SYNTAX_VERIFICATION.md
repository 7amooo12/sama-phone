# SQL Syntax Verification - DATABASE_INTEGRITY_INVESTIGATION.sql

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: SQL ambiguity error in the summary report section where `created_at` column reference was ambiguous between `client_vouchers` and `vouchers` tables in the LEFT JOIN.

**Location**: Lines 145-146 in the `orphaned_stats` CTE

**Original Code (Problematic)**:
```sql
WITH orphaned_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_orphaned,
        COUNT(DISTINCT client_id) as affected_clients,
        MIN(created_at) as oldest_orphaned,  -- ❌ AMBIGUOUS
        MAX(created_at) as newest_orphaned   -- ❌ AMBIGUOUS
    FROM public.client_vouchers cv
    LEFT JOIN public.vouchers v ON cv.voucher_id = v.id
    WHERE v.id IS NULL
)
```

**Fixed Code**:
```sql
WITH orphaned_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        COUNT(*) as total_orphaned,
        COUNT(DISTINCT cv.client_id) as affected_clients,
        MIN(cv.created_at) as oldest_orphaned,  -- ✅ QUALIFIED
        MAX(cv.created_at) as newest_orphaned   -- ✅ QUALIFIED
    FROM public.client_vouchers cv
    LEFT JOIN public.vouchers v ON cv.voucher_id = v.id
    WHERE v.id IS NULL
)
```

## Changes Made
1. **Line 144**: Changed `COUNT(DISTINCT client_id)` to `COUNT(DISTINCT cv.client_id)`
2. **Line 145**: Changed `MIN(created_at)` to `MIN(cv.created_at)`
3. **Line 146**: Changed `MAX(created_at)` to `MAX(cv.created_at)`

## Verification
✅ **All column references properly qualified**: Every column reference in JOIN queries now uses appropriate table aliases
✅ **Functionality preserved**: The script still finds the oldest and newest orphaned client voucher creation dates
✅ **No other ambiguous references**: Reviewed entire script - all other JOIN queries already properly qualified

## Other JOIN Queries Verified (Already Correct)
1. **Lines 27-40**: Orphaned records query - ✅ All columns properly qualified
2. **Lines 62-75**: Specific client query - ✅ All columns properly qualified  
3. **Lines 95-101**: Status analysis query - ✅ All columns properly qualified
4. **Lines 104-109**: Affected clients query - ✅ All columns properly qualified

## Expected Behavior
The script will now run without SQL syntax errors while maintaining the same functionality:
- Identifies all orphaned client voucher records
- Checks specific problematic voucher IDs
- Analyzes impact on affected clients
- Generates comprehensive integrity summary
- Reports oldest and newest orphaned record creation dates

## Usage
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
\i DATABASE_INTEGRITY_INVESTIGATION.sql
```

The script is now ready for production use to investigate database integrity issues in the voucher system.

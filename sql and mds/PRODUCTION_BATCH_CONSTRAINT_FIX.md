# 🔧 Production Batch Constraint Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
The Production Batch Details Screen was failing with a database constraint violation error:

```
new row for relation "tool_usage_history" violates check constraint "tool_usage_history_operation_type_check"
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The `tool_usage_history` table has a check constraint that only allows these operation types:
- `'production'`
- `'adjustment'`
- `'import'`
- `'export'`

But our SQL function was using `'production_update'` which is **not allowed**.

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Step 1: Deploy Fixed SQL Functions**

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
   - Create a new query

2. **Execute the Fix**:
   Copy and paste the entire content from `sql/fix_production_batch_operation_type.sql` and execute it.

   **Key Fix**: Changed operation type from `'production_update'` to `'production'` in line 85 of the function.

### **Step 2: Verify Deployment**

After executing the SQL, you should see these success messages:
```
✅ All production batch management functions have been created/updated
📋 Functions available:
   - update_production_batch_quantity(batch_id, new_quantity, notes)
   - get_product_warehouse_locations(product_id)
   - add_production_inventory_to_warehouse(product_id, quantity, warehouse_id, batch_id, notes)
🔧 Fixed: Changed operation_type from "production_update" to "production"
```

### **Step 3: Test the Fix**

1. **Restart your Flutter app** to ensure fresh connections
2. **Navigate to Production Batch Details Screen**:
   - Go to Manufacturing Production Screen
   - Long-press on any production card
3. **Test Quantity Update**:
   - Tap the edit icon next to "الكمية المنتجة"
   - Enter a new quantity
   - Tap "حفظ" (Save)
4. **Expected Result**: The operation should complete successfully without constraint errors

## 📋 **What the Fix Does**

### **Before (Broken)**:
```sql
PERFORM update_tool_quantity(
    v_recipe.tool_id,
    v_new_tool_stock,
    'production_update',  -- ❌ NOT ALLOWED
    'تحديث كمية دفعة الإنتاج...',
    p_batch_id
);
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```sql
PERFORM update_tool_quantity(
    v_recipe.tool_id,
    v_new_tool_stock,
    'production',  -- ✅ ALLOWED
    'تحديث كمية دفعة الإنتاج...',
    p_batch_id
);
```

## 🎯 **Functions Deployed**

1. **`update_production_batch_quantity()`**:
   - Updates production batch quantities
   - Automatically deducts manufacturing materials
   - Uses correct `'production'` operation type

2. **`get_product_warehouse_locations()`**:
   - Retrieves warehouse locations for products
   - Shows stock quantities and status
   - Returns JSON with warehouse information

3. **`add_production_inventory_to_warehouse()`**:
   - Adds produced inventory to warehouses
   - Creates transaction records
   - Handles warehouse selection automatically

## 🔒 **Security & Permissions**

All functions are created with:
- `SECURITY DEFINER` for proper authorization
- `GRANT EXECUTE TO authenticated` for user access
- Proper user ID validation using `auth.uid()`

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] SQL functions deployed successfully
- [ ] Flutter app restarted
- [ ] Production batch quantity update works
- [ ] No constraint violation errors
- [ ] Warehouse locations display correctly
- [ ] Manufacturing tools are deducted properly
- [ ] Inventory is added to warehouses
- [ ] Loading states work properly
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

## 🚀 **Expected User Experience**

After the fix, users should be able to:

1. **Edit Production Quantities**: Tap edit icon and modify quantities
2. **See Real-time Updates**: UI refreshes immediately after save
3. **View Warehouse Locations**: See where products are stored with stock levels
4. **Automatic Inventory Management**: System handles material deduction and inventory addition
5. **Professional Feedback**: Loading states and success/error messages in Arabic

## 📞 **If Issues Persist**

If you still encounter errors after deployment:

1. **Check Function Existence**:
   ```sql
   SELECT routine_name 
   FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_name LIKE '%production_batch%';
   ```

2. **Verify Permissions**:
   ```sql
   SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
   FROM information_schema.routine_privileges 
   WHERE routine_name = 'update_production_batch_quantity';
   ```

3. **Test Function Directly**:
   ```sql
   SELECT update_production_batch_quantity(1, 10.0, 'Test update');
   ```

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

When everything works correctly, you'll see:
- ✅ Production batch quantities update successfully
- ✅ Warehouse locations display with current stock
- ✅ Manufacturing tools are automatically deducted
- ✅ Inventory is added to appropriate warehouses
- ✅ Professional loading states and feedback messages
- ✅ No database constraint errors in logs

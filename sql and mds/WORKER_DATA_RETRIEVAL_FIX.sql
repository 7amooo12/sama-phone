-- WORKER DATA RETRIEVAL FIX
-- Fixes RLS policies to allow proper worker data access
-- =====================================================

-- STEP 1: BACKUP CURRENT POLICIES
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== BACKING UP CURRENT POLICIES ===' as backup_info;

-- Show current policies before modification
SELECT 
    'Current user_profiles policies' as info,
    policyname,
    cmd,
    roles,
    qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'user_profiles'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- STEP 2: REMOVE PROBLEMATIC RECURSIVE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== REMOVING PROBLEMATIC POLICIES ===' as cleanup_info;

-- Remove policies that might cause recursion or access issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can view all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can update all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can insert all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update all profiles" ON public.user_profiles;

-- Remove any other potentially problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "View own profile or admin bypass" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Approved users or admin can read profile" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Only approved users can update" ON public.user_profiles;

-- STEP 3: CREATE SAFE, NON-RECURSIVE POLICIES
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== CREATING SAFE POLICIES ===' as policy_creation;

-- Policy 1: Service role full access (for system operations)
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_service_role_access" ON public.user_profiles
FOR ALL TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy 2: Users can view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_view_own" ON public.user_profiles
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 3: Users can update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_update_own" ON public.user_profiles
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (id = auth.uid())
WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 4: Users can insert their own profile during signup
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_insert_own" ON public.user_profiles
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());

-- Policy 5: CRITICAL - Allow authenticated users to view worker profiles
-- This is the key policy that was missing and causing worker loading issues
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_view_workers" ON public.user_profiles
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (role = 'worker' AND status IN ('approved', 'active'));

-- Policy 6: Allow authenticated users to view all profiles for admin operations
-- This enables admin dashboards to load user data properly
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_admin_view_all" ON public.user_profiles
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM auth.users 
        WHERE auth.users.id = auth.uid()
    )
);

-- STEP 4: CREATE SAFE ADMIN ACCESS FUNCTION
-- =====================================================

-- Create a function to check admin status without recursion
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_admin_user()
RETURNS boolean
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
STABLE
AS $$
    SELECT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM public.user_profiles 
        WHERE id = auth.uid() 
        AND role IN ('admin', 'owner', 'accountant')
        AND status IN ('active', 'approved')
        LIMIT 1
    );
$$;

-- Grant permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.is_admin_user() TO authenticated;

-- Policy 7: Admin users can manage all profiles using safe function
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_admin_manage_all" ON public.user_profiles
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (public.is_admin_user())
WITH CHECK (public.is_admin_user());

-- STEP 5: ENSURE RLS IS PROPERLY CONFIGURED
-- =====================================================

-- Ensure RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- STEP 6: TEST THE FIX
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== TESTING THE FIX ===' as test_section;

-- Test 1: Check if workers are now visible
SELECT 
    'Workers visible after fix' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as count

-- Test 2: Check approved workers
SELECT 
    'Approved workers visible' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.user_profiles
WHERE role = 'worker'
AND status IN ('approved', 'active');

-- Test 3: Check if admin function works
SELECT 
    'Admin function test' as test_name,
    public.is_admin_user() as result;

-- Test 4: Simulate the getUsersByRole query
SELECT
    'getUsersByRole simulation' as test_name,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.user_profiles
WHERE role = 'worker'
AND (status = 'approved' OR status = 'active');

-- STEP 7: VERIFY POLICY STRUCTURE
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== FINAL POLICY VERIFICATION ===' as verification;

-- Show final policies
SELECT 
    'Final user_profiles policies' as info,
    policyname,

    COUNT(*) as count
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'user_profiles'
AND (qual LIKE '%user_profiles%' OR with_check LIKE '%user_profiles%');

-- STEP 8: ADDITIONAL WORKER-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATIONS
-- =====================================================

-- Create an index for faster worker queries if it doesn't exist
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_profiles_role_status 
ON public.user_profiles(role, status) 
WHERE role = 'worker';

-- Create an index for name ordering
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_profiles_name 
ON public.user_profiles(name) 
WHERE role = 'worker';

-- STEP 9: SUCCESS VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== SUCCESS VERIFICATION ===' as final_check;

-- Final verification that workers are accessible
DO $$
DECLARE
    worker_count INTEGER;
    approved_worker_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    -- Count total workers
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO worker_count

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO approved_worker_count
    FROM public.user_profiles
    WHERE role = 'worker'
    AND status IN ('approved', 'active');
    
    -- Report results
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Total workers found: %', worker_count;
    RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ Approved workers found: %', approved_worker_count;
    
    IF worker_count > 0 THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'üéâ SUCCESS: Worker data retrieval should now work in Flutter app';
    ELSE
        RAISE NOTICE '‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No workers found in database - check worker registration';
    END IF;

-- STEP 10: FLUTTER APP TESTING GUIDANCE
-- =====================================================

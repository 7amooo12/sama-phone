-- ============================================================================
-- TEST ACCOUNTANT SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
-- ============================================================================
-- This script tests all search functionality for the Accountant role
-- to ensure RLS policies are working correctly
-- ============================================================================

-- ==================== STEP 1: SETUP TEST CONTEXT ====================

-- Set the current user context to an accountant user
-- Replace this UUID with an actual accountant user ID from your system
-- You can find accountant user IDs by running:
-- SELECT id, email, name FROM user_profiles WHERE role = 'accountant' AND status = 'approved';

-- For testing purposes, we'll use a placeholder
-- In production, this would be set automatically by Supabase auth
-- SET LOCAL "request.jwt.claims" = '{"sub": "YOUR_ACCOUNTANT_USER_ID_HERE"}';

-- ==================== STEP 2: TEST BASIC TABLE ACCESS ====================

-- Test 1: Can accountant read products?

  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ SUCCESS - Can read products'

  END as test_result

  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ SUCCESS - Can read warehouse inventory'

  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ SUCCESS - Can read warehouses'
    ELSE '‚ùå FAILED - Cannot read warehouses'
  END as test_result

-- Test 4: Can accountant read user profiles?
SELECT

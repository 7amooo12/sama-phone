-- 4. GRANT PERMISSIONS
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- 5. TEST THE FIX WITH ACTUAL INSERT
-- =====================================================

-- Test insert with the exact data structure from Flutter app
INSERT INTO public.client_orders (

    client_name,
    client_email,
    client_phone,
    total_amount,

    notes,
    shipping_address,
    metadata
) VALUES (
    auth.uid(),
    'Test Customer',
    'test@example.com',
    '+1234567890',
    100.50,
    'pending',
    'pending',
    'Test order from RLS fix',
    '{"address": "Test Address"}',
    '{"created_from": "rls_fix_test", "items_count": 1}'
);

-- Check if the insert worked
SELECT 
    'INSERT TEST RESULT:' as test_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM public.client_orders 
            WHERE client_id = auth.uid()

        ) THEN 'SUCCESS: Test order created'
        ELSE 'FAILED: Test order not created'
    END as result;

-- Clean up test data
DELETE FROM public.client_orders 
WHERE client_id = auth.uid() 
AND notes = 'Test order from RLS fix';

-- =====================================================
-- 6. VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

-- Show final policy status
SELECT 
    'FINAL POLICIES:' as info,
    policyname,
    cmd as command
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'client_orders' 
AND schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Show RLS status
SELECT 
    'RLS STATUS:' as info,
    rowsecurity as enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'client_orders';

-- Show current user info
SELECT 
    'CURRENT USER:' as info,
    auth.uid() as user_id,
    up.name,
    up.role,
    up.status
FROM public.user_profiles up
WHERE up.id = auth.uid();

-- Final success message
SELECT 'TARGETED RLS FIX COMPLETED - Order creation should now work' as status;

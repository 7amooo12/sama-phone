## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Service Layer Updates**
**File: `lib/services/voucher_service.dart`**

#### **Enhanced Individual Deletion**
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> deleteVoucher(String voucherId, {bool forceDelete = false})
```
- **Force Delete**: When `true`, deletes all related assignments first
- **Constraint Checking**: Validates active assignments before deletion
- **Comprehensive Response**: Returns detailed result with deletion status

#### **New Bulk Deletion Method**
```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> deleteAllVouchers({bool forceDelete = false})
```
- **Batch Processing**: Deletes all vouchers in the system
- **Assignment Cleanup**: Removes all client voucher assignments when force enabled
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient database queries

### **Provider Layer Updates**
**File: `lib/providers/voucher_provider.dart`**

#### **Updated Methods**
- `deleteVoucher(String voucherId, {bool forceDelete = false})`
- `deleteAllVouchers({bool forceDelete = false})`

Both methods:
- Update local state after successful deletion
- Provide comprehensive error handling
- Return detailed result maps for UI feedback

### **UI Layer Updates**
**File: `lib/screens/admin/voucher_management_screen.dart`**

#### **Header Enhancement**
- Added "Clear All Vouchers" button (delete sweep icon)
- Button only visible when vouchers exist
- Positioned next to refresh button

#### **Enhanced Deletion Dialogs**
1. **Individual Voucher Dialog**: Force deletion checkbox option
2. **Bulk Deletion Dialog**: Comprehensive warning and force option

---

## üîí **Safety Features**

### **Confirmation Dialogs**
- **Individual**: Warns about active assignments
- **Bulk**: Multiple warnings about permanent deletion
- **Force Options**: Clear explanation of consequences

### **Constraint Handling**

## üìã **Testing Checklist**

### **Individual Voucher Deletion**
- [ ] Delete voucher without assignments ‚úÖ Should succeed
- [ ] Delete voucher with active assignments ‚ùå Should show error
- [ ] Force delete voucher with active assignments ‚úÖ Should succeed
- [ ] Delete voucher with only used assignments ‚úÖ Should succeed
- [ ] Verify assignments are deleted with force option

### **Bulk Voucher Deletion**
- [ ] Clear all button appears when vouchers exist
- [ ] Clear all button hidden when no vouchers
- [ ] Bulk delete without force (no active assignments) ‚úÖ Should succeed
- [ ] Bulk delete without force (with active assignments) ‚ùå Should show error
- [ ] Force bulk delete with active assignments ‚úÖ Should succeed
- [ ] Verify all vouchers and assignments are deleted

### **UI/UX Testing**
- [ ] Dialogs display correctly with proper styling
- [ ] Loading states show during operations
- [ ] Success/error messages appear appropriately
- [ ] Navigation works correctly after operations

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Database Considerations**
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: The system handles client_vouchers relationships
- **Cascade Deletion**: Force delete removes assignments before vouchers
- **Transaction Safety**: Operations are atomic where possible

### **Permission Requirements**
- **RLS Policies**: Ensure voucher deletion policies allow authenticated users
- **Role-Based Access**: Only admin/owner/accountant roles should access deletion
- **Service Role**: System operations use service role for cleanup

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient queries for large datasets
- **UI Responsiveness**: Loading states prevent UI blocking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures

---

## üîÑ **Error Scenarios & Handling**

### **Common Error Cases**
1. **RLS Policy Violations**: Fixed with recent voucher RLS policy updates
2. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Handled by deleting assignments first
3. **Network Failures**: Proper error messages and retry options
4. **Permission Denied**: Clear feedback about insufficient permissions

### **Recovery Actions**
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Users can retry failed operations
- **Partial Failures**: Clear indication of what succeeded/failed
- **Rollback Safety**: Database constraints prevent partial corruption

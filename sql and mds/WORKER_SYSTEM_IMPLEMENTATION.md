import 'package:smartbiztracker_new/screens/worker/worker_dashboard_screen.dart';
import 'package:smartbiztracker_new/screens/admin/admin_task_review_screen.dart';
import 'package:smartbiztracker_new/screens/admin/admin_rewards_management_screen.dart';
```

### **Navigation Integration:**
Add to your existing navigation system:
```dart
// For workers
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => const WorkerDashboardScreen(),
));

// For admins
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => const AdminTaskReviewScreen(),
));
Navigator.push(context, MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (context) => const AdminRewardsManagementScreen(),
));
```

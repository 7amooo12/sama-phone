# Supabase Authentication and User Profile Creation Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes implemented to resolve critical Supabase authentication and user profile creation errors during app startup.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Duplicate Key Constraint Errors (PostgrestException 23505)
**Problem**: App repeatedly failing to create user profiles due to "duplicate key value violates unique constraint 'user_profiles_email_key'" errors.

**Root Cause**: The app was attempting to create profiles for users that already existed in the database without checking for existing records first.

**Solution**:
- Added `userExistsByEmail()` method to check if user profile exists before creation
- Added `authUserExistsByEmail()` method to check if auth user exists
- Implemented proper duplicate checking in `signUp()` method
- Enhanced `createMissingUserProfile()` to use `upsert` instead of `insert`
- Added comprehensive duplicate key constraint error handling

### 2. Authentication Permission Issues (AuthApiException 403)
**Problem**: "User not allowed" errors when trying to delete auth users after profile creation failures.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient permissions for cleanup operations using admin API.

**Solution**:
- Removed admin.deleteUser() calls that require elevated permissions
- Implemented graceful cleanup by signing out instead of deleting
- Added proper error handling for permission-related failures
- Focused on profile creation success rather than auth user cleanup

### 3. Invalid Login Credentials (AuthApiException 400)
**Problem**: Multiple "Invalid login credentials" errors during sign-in attempts.

**Root Cause**: Test users being created with inconsistent states between auth and profile tables.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced test user creation logic to check existing users first
- Implemented proper user verification before creation attempts
- Added login testing after user creation to ensure functionality
- Improved error handling for credential-related issues

### 4. Test User Creation Logic Issues
**Problem**: `_createTestUsers` function repeatedly attempting to create existing test users.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient checking for existing users before creation attempts.

**Solution**:
- Completely rewrote test user creation logic
- Added comprehensive user existence checking
- Implemented proper handling of existing auth users with missing profiles
- Added user verification and approval status updates
- Implemented graceful handling of creation failures

## Key Changes Made

### SupabaseService.dart
1. **New Methods Added**:
   - `userExistsByEmail()`: Check if user profile exists
   - `authUserExistsByEmail()`: Check if auth user exists
   
2. **Enhanced Methods**:
   - `signUp()`: Now checks for existing users before creation
   - `createMissingUserProfile()`: Uses upsert and better error handling
   
3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Specific handling for duplicate key constraints
   - Better cleanup logic without admin permissions
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

### main.dart
1. **Test User Creation**:
   - Complete rewrite of `_createTestUsers()` function
   - Added `_shouldCreateTestUsers()` flag for control
   - Implemented step-by-step user verification
   - Added proper login testing and sign-out logic
   
2. **Development Mode Control**:
   - Added flag to enable/disable test user creation
   - Better error handling for local fallback users
   - Improved logging for debugging

### AdminSetup.dart
1. **Enhanced Admin Creation**:
   - Better checking for existing admin auth users
   - Improved profile creation for existing users
   - More robust error handling

## Configuration Options

### Disable Test User Creation
To disable test user creation in development, change this in `main.dart`:
```dart
bool _shouldCreateTestUsers() {
  const bool enableTestUsers = false; // Set to false to disable
  return enableTestUsers;
}
```

### Environment-Based Control
You can enhance the control by using environment variables:
```dart
bool _shouldCreateTestUsers() {
  return const bool.fromEnvironment('CREATE_TEST_USERS', defaultValue: true);
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Clean Startup**: App should start without authentication errors
2. **Existing User Handling**: Gracefully handles users that already exist
3. **Profile Consistency**: Ensures auth users have corresponding profiles
4. **Error Recovery**: Recovers from duplicate key and permission errors
5. **Development Control**: Allows disabling test user creation when needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clean Database Test**: Test with empty database to verify user creation
2. **Existing Users Test**: Test with existing users to verify no duplicates
3. **Partial Data Test**: Test with auth users missing profiles
4. **Error Recovery Test**: Test recovery from various error conditions
5. **Production Mode Test**: Test with test user creation disabled

## Monitoring and Debugging

The fixes include comprehensive logging to help monitor and debug issues:
- User existence checks are logged
- Creation attempts and results are logged
- Error conditions are properly logged with context
- Success confirmations include verification steps

## Future Improvements

1. **Database Migrations**: Consider implementing proper database migrations
2. **User Sync Service**: Create a service to sync auth users with profiles
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Add admin interface for user management
4. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated tests for user creation scenarios
5. **Configuration Management**: Use proper configuration management for environment-specific settings

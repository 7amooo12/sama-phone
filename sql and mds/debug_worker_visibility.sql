-- DEBUG WORKER VISIBILITY IN ATTENDANCE REPORTS
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- This script investigates why new workers are not appearing
-- in attendance reports despite being registered in the system
--

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 1: CHECK ALL WORKERS IN SYSTEM
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== ALL WORKERS IN SYSTEM ===' as section;

SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    email,
    role,
    status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM user_profiles
WHERE role IN ('worker', 'ÿπÿßŸÖŸÑ')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 2: CHECK WORKERS BY ROLE AND STATUS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== WORKERS BY ROLE AND STATUS ===' as section;

-- Count by role
SELECT 
    'Workers by role' as category,
    role,
    status,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM user_profiles

GROUP BY role, status
ORDER BY role, status;

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 3: TEST DATABASE FUNCTION QUERY
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== TESTING DATABASE FUNCTION QUERY ===' as section;

-- Test the exact query used in get_worker_attendance_report_data
SELECT

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 4: CHECK RECENT WORKER REGISTRATIONS
-- =====================================================

SELECT

-- Check workers created in the last 24 hours
SELECT

-- STEP 6: TEST ATTENDANCE REPORT FUNCTION
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 7: IDENTIFY MISSING WORKERS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== WORKERS NOT IN ATTENDANCE REPORTS ===' as section;

-- Find workers that should be in reports but aren't
WITH report_workers AS (
    SELECT worker_id

-- =====================================================
-- STEP 8: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
-- =====================================================

SELECT 
    '=== SUMMARY ===' as section;

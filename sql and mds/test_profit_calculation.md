# Product Movement Profit Calculation Fix

## Problem Description
The "Total Profit" (Ø¥Ø¬Ù…Ø§Ù„ÙŠ Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨Ø­) field in the Product Movement Report was showing zero instead of the correct calculated value.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `ProductMovementService.dart` file where the profit calculation logic had the following problems:

1. **Limited Cost Sources**: Only used `product.sellingPrice` and `product.purchasePrice`
2. **No Fallback Logic**: When purchase price was null or zero, profit calculation failed
3. **Ignored Real Sales Data**: Didn't use actual unit prices from sales transactions
4. **Missing Manufacturing Cost**: Didn't consider `manufacturingCost` field

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ProductMovementProductModel
Added new cost fields to support multiple cost sources:
```dart
class ProductMovementProductModel {
  final double? purchasePrice;
  final double? sellingPrice;
  final double? manufacturingCost;  // NEW
  final double? costPrice;          // NEW
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Profit Calculation Method
Created `_calculateProfitMetrics()` method with intelligent cost determination:

#### Cost Price Priority Order:
1. Direct cost price from product data
2. Purchase price from product data  
3. Manufacturing cost from product data
4. Estimated cost from selling price (70% rule)
5. Estimated cost from average sale price (70% rule)

#### Selling Price Priority Order:
1. Average price from actual sales data (most accurate)
2. Selling price from product data
3. Estimated selling price from purchase price (130% markup)

### 3. Enhanced Profit Calculation Logic
```dart
// Calculate profit per unit
profitPerUnit = sellingPrice - costPrice;

// Calculate total profit using actual sales data
totalProfit = salesData.fold<double>(0.0, (sum, sale) {
  final saleProfit = (sale.unitPrice - costPrice) * sale.quantity;
  return sum + saleProfit;
});

// Calculate profit margin
profitMargin = (profitPerUnit / sellingPrice) * 100;
```

### 4. Improved Currency Formatting
Updated currency formatting to properly display Egyptian Pounds:
```dart
final NumberFormat _currencyFormat = NumberFormat.currency(
  symbol: 'Ø¬.Ù… ',
  decimalDigits: 2,
  locale: 'ar_EG',
);
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Product with Purchase Price
- Product: "Ù…Ù†ØªØ¬ Ø£"
- Purchase Price: 100 Ø¬.Ù…
- Selling Price: 150 Ø¬.Ù…
- Expected Profit per Unit: 50 Ø¬.Ù…
- Expected Profit Margin: 33.33%

### Test Case 2: Product with Manufacturing Cost
- Product: "Ù…Ù†ØªØ¬ Ø¨"
- Manufacturing Cost: 80 Ø¬.Ù…
- Average Sale Price: 120 Ø¬.Ù…
- Expected Profit per Unit: 40 Ø¬.Ù…
- Expected Profit Margin: 33.33%

### Test Case 3: Product with Estimated Cost
- Product: "Ù…Ù†ØªØ¬ Ø¬"
- No cost data available
- Average Sale Price: 200 Ø¬.Ù…
- Estimated Cost (70%): 140 Ø¬.Ù…
- Expected Profit per Unit: 60 Ø¬.Ù…
- Expected Profit Margin: 30%

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:

1. âœ… **Profit Per Unit**: Shows correct calculated value instead of zero
2. âœ… **Total Profit**: Displays accurate total profit from all sales
3. âœ… **Profit Margin**: Shows correct percentage margin
4. âœ… **Currency Formatting**: Proper Egyptian Pounds display
5. âœ… **Fallback Logic**: Works even when cost data is missing
6. âœ… **Real Sales Data**: Uses actual transaction prices for accuracy

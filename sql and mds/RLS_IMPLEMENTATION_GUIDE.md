# SmartBizTracker RLS Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies across all 18 tables in your SmartBizTracker application.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Execute SQL Scripts in Order

**IMPORTANT**: Execute these scripts in the exact order listed below in your Supabase SQL Editor.

1. **First**: `configure_all_rls_policies.sql` (Tables 1-5 + Helper Functions)
2. **Second**: `configure_all_rls_policies_part2.sql` (Tables 6-12)
3. **Third**: `configure_all_rls_policies_part3.sql` (Tables 13-18)

### Step 2: Verify Implementation

After running all scripts, verify the policies are created:

```sql
-- Check all policies across tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### Step 3: Test Access Control

Test with different user roles to ensure proper access:

1. **Admin User**: Should have full access to all tables
2. **Worker User**: Should only access assigned tasks and own records
3. **Client User**: Should only access own orders and public data
4. **Anonymous User**: Should only access public data (products, etc.)

## Key Features Implemented

### Helper Functions
- `auth.is_admin()` - Checks if current user is admin
- `auth.is_worker()` - Checks if current user is worker  
- `auth.is_client()` - Checks if current user is client

### Priority Fixes
- **task_feedback**: Fixed RLS enabled but no policies issue
- **task_submissions**: Fixed RLS enabled but no policies issue

### Security Patterns
- **Own Records Only**: Users can only access their own data
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for admin/worker/client
- **Assigned Tasks**: Workers only see tasks assigned to them
- **Public Data**: Products viewable by everyone
- **Service Role**: System operations for automated processes

## Table-by-Table Summary

### 1. client_order_items (5 policies)

- Staff: Update and view
- Clients: Create and view own orders

### 3. favorites (1 policy)
- Users: Manage own favorites only

- Users: View and update own notifications

### 5. order_history (4 policies)
- Admins: View all
- Staff: View all
- Clients: View own history
- System: Create entries

### 6. order_items (2 policies)
- Admins: View all
- Users: View own items

### 7. order_notifications (4 policies)

- Users: View and update own

### 8. order_tracking_links (5 policies)
- Admins: Full access
- Staff: Create links
- Clients: View own links
- Creators: Update own links

### 9. orders (4 policies)
- Admins: Full access
- Users: Create and view own orders

### 10. products (2 policies)
- Admins: Full management
- Everyone: View access

### 11. task_feedback (4 policies) ⚠️ PRIORITY
- Admins: Full management
- Workers: Create/view/update for assigned tasks

### 12. task_submissions (4 policies) ⚠️ PRIORITY
- Admins: Full management
- Workers: Create/view/update for assigned tasks

### 13. tasks (9 policies)
- Admins: Full access
- Workers: View/update assigned tasks
- Temporary: All authenticated users (for testing)

### 14. todos (4 policies)
- Everyone: View all
- Users: Manage own todos

### 15. user_profiles (9 policies)
- Admins: Full access
- Users: Manage own profile
- Public: View public profiles
- Signup: Create during registration

### 16. worker_reward_balances (3 policies)
- Admins: View all
- Workers: View own balance
- System: Full management

### 17. worker_rewards (5 policies)
- Admins: Full management
- Workers: View own rewards

### 18. worker_tasks (5 policies)
- Admins: Full management
- Workers: View/update assigned tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - Verify user role in user_profiles table
   - Check if policies are enabled
   - Ensure user is authenticated

2. **Helper Functions Not Working**
   - Make sure Part 1 script ran successfully
   - Verify functions exist: `SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE 'is_%';`

3. **Policies Not Applied**
   - Check RLS is enabled: `SELECT relname, relrowsecurity FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN ('tasks', 'user_profiles');`
   - Verify policies exist: `SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'your_table';`

### Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check RLS status for all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       CASE WHEN rowsecurity THEN 'Enabled' ELSE 'Disabled' END as rls_status
FROM pg_tables t
JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.tablename
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Count policies per table
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: Run your Flutter app and test various operations
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any remaining permission errors
3. **Adjust Policies**: Fine-tune policies based on actual usage patterns
4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of any custom modifications

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the verification queries above
2. Review the error messages for specific table/operation
3. Ensure all three SQL scripts were executed successfully
4. Verify user roles are properly set in user_profiles table

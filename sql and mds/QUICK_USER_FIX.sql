-- QUICK USER PROFILE FIX - BYPASS WALLET ISSUE
-- =====================================================
-- This script fixes user profiles without triggering wallet errors
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- 1. TEMPORARILY DISABLE WALLET TRIGGERS
-- =====================================================

-- Disable any triggers that create wallets automatically
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS create_wallet_on_user_insert ON public.user_profiles;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_create_user_wallet ON public.user_profiles;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS create_user_wallet_trigger ON public.user_profiles;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. CHECK EXISTING USERS
-- =====================================================

-- Show current state of users
SELECT 
    'CURRENT USER STATE:' as section,
    COUNT(*) as total_auth_users
FROM auth.users;

SELECT 
    'CURRENT PROFILE STATE:' as section,
    COUNT(*) as total_profiles

    au.created_at
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles up ON au.id = up.id
WHERE up.id IS NULL;

-- =====================================================
-- 3. CREATE MISSING USER PROFILES
-- =====================================================

-- Insert missing profiles for all auth users

    up.status,
    CASE 
        WHEN up.role IN ('admin', 'owner', 'accountant', 'manager') AND up.status = 'approved' 
        THEN '✅ FULL ACCESS - Can create any orders'
        WHEN up.role = 'client' AND up.status = 'approved' 
        THEN '✅ CLIENT ACCESS - Can create own orders'
        WHEN up.role = 'worker' AND up.status = 'approved'

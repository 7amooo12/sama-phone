# Treasury Transaction Types Fix - Test Plan

## Issue Summary
The PostgreSQL check constraint violation error occurred because the application was using transaction types (`'deposit'`, `'withdrawal'`) that were not allowed by the database constraint.

## Root Cause
- Database constraint in `treasury_transactions` table only allowed: `'credit'`, `'debit'`, `'connection'`, `'disconnection'`, `'exchange_rate_update'`, `'transfer_in'`, `'transfer_out'`, `'balance_adjustment'`
- Application was using: `'deposit'`, `'withdrawal'`, `'balance_adjustment'`

## Fix Applied
Updated the following files to use correct transaction types:

### 1. `lib/screens/treasury_control/tabs/treasury_balance_tab.dart`
- Changed `'deposit'` → `'credit'` (line 1090)
- Changed `'withdrawal'` → `'debit'` (line 1135)
- Kept `'balance_adjustment'` as is (already correct)

### 2. `lib/utils/treasury_validation.dart`
- Updated `_isValidTransactionType()` method to validate against correct database constraint values

## Files Already Correct
- `lib/services/treasury_transaction_service.dart` - Already using `'credit'` and `'debit'`
- `lib/models/treasury_models.dart` - TreasuryTransactionType enum already correct
- `lib/widgets/treasury/sub_treasury_card_widget.dart` - Already using `'balance_adjustment'`

## Test Cases to Verify Fix

### Test 1: Deposit Operation (إيداع)
1. Navigate to Treasury Management → Balance Tab
2. Click "إيداع" button
3. Enter amount and description
4. Confirm operation
5. **Expected**: Transaction completes successfully with `transaction_type = 'credit'`

### Test 2: Withdrawal Operation (سحب)
1. Navigate to Treasury Management → Balance Tab
2. Click "سحب" button
3. Enter amount and description
4. Confirm operation
5. **Expected**: Transaction completes successfully with `transaction_type = 'debit'`

### Test 3: Balance Adjustment (تعديل الرصيد)
1. Navigate to Treasury Management → Balance Tab
2. Click "تعديل" button
3. Enter new balance and description
4. Confirm operation
5. **Expected**: Transaction completes successfully with `transaction_type = 'balance_adjustment'`

### Test 4: Database Verification
Query the database to verify transaction types:
```sql
SELECT transaction_type, COUNT(*) 
FROM treasury_transactions 
GROUP BY transaction_type;
```

**Expected transaction types**: Only `'credit'`, `'debit'`, `'connection'`, `'disconnection'`, `'exchange_rate_update'`, `'transfer_in'`, `'transfer_out'`, `'balance_adjustment'`

## Migration Status
Ensure the following migration has been applied:
- `supabase/migrations/20241225_fix_treasury_transaction_constraints.sql`

This migration updates the constraint to include all valid transaction types including `'balance_adjustment'`, `'transfer_in'`, and `'transfer_out'`.

## Summary of Changes Made

### ✅ Fixed Files:
1. **`lib/screens/treasury_control/tabs/treasury_balance_tab.dart`**
   - Line 1090: `'deposit'` → `'credit'`
   - Line 1135: `'withdrawal'` → `'debit'`

2. **`lib/utils/treasury_validation.dart`**
   - Updated `_isValidTransactionType()` to validate against correct constraint values

### ✅ Already Correct Files:
- `lib/services/treasury_transaction_service.dart` - Uses `'credit'` and `'debit'`
- `lib/models/treasury_models.dart` - TreasuryTransactionType enum correct
- `lib/widgets/treasury/sub_treasury_card_widget.dart` - Uses `'balance_adjustment'`

### ✅ Database Constraint (After Migration):
```sql
CHECK (transaction_type IN (
    'credit',
    'debit',
    'connection',
    'disconnection',
    'exchange_rate_update',
    'transfer_in',
    'transfer_out',
    'balance_adjustment'
))
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the treasury operations to ensure they work without constraint violations
2. Monitor the application logs for any remaining transaction type issues
3. Consider adding unit tests for treasury transaction type validation

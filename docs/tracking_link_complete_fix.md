# Complete Fix for Tracking Link Database Issues

## Problem Summary

The SmartBizTracker Flutter app was experiencing PostgreSQL database errors related to the `tracking_link` column in the `user_profiles` table:

1. **PGRST204 Error**: "Could not find the 'tracking_link' column of 'user_profiles' in the schema cache"
2. **URI Error**: "No host specified in URI file:///null" when handling null tracking_link values
3. **RLS Policy Issues**: Overly permissive RLS policy causing conflicts

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, we found:
- ✅ The `tracking_link` column **DOES exist** in the database (confirmed via schema query)
- ❌ The RLS policy `user_profiles_open_access` was too permissive and causing conflicts
- ❌ Null tracking_link values were being passed to URI parsing functions
- ❌ Supabase schema cache might be outdated

## Complete Solution Implementation

### 1. Database RLS Policy Fix

**File**: `sql/fix_user_profiles_rls_policies.sql`

This script:
- Removes the overly permissive `user_profiles_open_access` policy
- Creates specific, secure policies for different operations:
  - `authenticated_users_select_own_profile` - Users can view their own profile
  - `authenticated_users_update_own_profile` - Users can update their own profile
  - `admins_select_all_profiles` - Admins can view all profiles
  - `admins_update_all_profiles` - Admins can update all profiles
  - `admins_insert_profiles` - Admins can create new profiles
  - `admins_delete_profiles` - Admins can delete profiles (with restrictions)
- Creates a secure function `update_user_tracking_link()` for safe tracking_link updates
- Refreshes the PostgREST schema cache

### 2. Flutter Code Improvements

#### DatabaseService Updates (`lib/services/database_service.dart`)
- Enhanced error handling with specific diagnostics
- Fallback mechanism when tracking_link column issues occur
- Better logging with solution suggestions
- Graceful handling of null values

#### URI Handling Fixes (`lib/screens/client/order_tracking_screen.dart`)
- Added validation before URI parsing
- Automatic scheme addition for URLs without http/https
- Proper null checking to prevent "file:///null" errors
- Better error messages for invalid URLs

#### Tracking Links Screen (`lib/screens/admin/tracking_links_screen.dart`)
- Fixed null handling in TextEditingController initialization
- Added URL format validation
- Improved user feedback for invalid URLs

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Execute Database Migration
Run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Execute: sql/fix_user_profiles_rls_policies.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
The script includes automatic testing and will show:
- ✅ Policy creation success messages
- ✅ Test results for tracking_link operations
- ✅ Schema cache refresh confirmation

### Step 3: Restart Your App
After running the SQL script:
1. Hot restart your Flutter app
2. Test user profile updates
3. Test tracking link functionality

## Expected Results

After applying the fix:
- ✅ No more PGRST204 errors when updating user profiles
- ✅ Tracking links handle null values gracefully
- ✅ URI parsing errors are eliminated
- ✅ Better security with specific RLS policies
- ✅ Improved error messages and diagnostics
- ✅ Business Owner Dashboard functions correctly

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User profile updates work without errors
- [ ] Tracking links can be set and updated
- [ ] Null tracking_link values don't cause crashes
- [ ] Invalid URLs show proper error messages
- [ ] Admin users can update any user's tracking_link
- [ ] Regular users can only update their own tracking_link
- [ ] Business Owner Dashboard displays correct data

## Security Improvements

The new RLS policies provide:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users can only access what they need
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged and traceable
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized modifications

## Performance Considerations

- Schema cache refresh improves query performance
- Specific policies reduce database overhead
- Better error handling reduces retry attempts
- Null value filtering prevents unnecessary database calls

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback by restoring the original policy:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_select_own_profile" ON public.user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_users_update_own_profile" ON public.user_profiles;
-- ... (drop other new policies)

CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_open_access" ON public.user_profiles
    FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your user has the correct role and status
3. Ensure your Supabase project is running the latest version
4. Contact Supabase support if schema cache issues persist

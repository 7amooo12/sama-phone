-- üö® SIMPLE WAREHOUSE ACCESS FIX (Alternative Approach)
-- If the function-based approach fails, use this simpler method

-- ==================== STEP 1: COMPLETELY DISABLE RLS (TEMPORARY) ====================

-- Disable RLS on all warehouse tables for immediate access restoration
ALTER TABLE warehouses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE warehouse_inventory DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE warehouse_transactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE warehouse_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Handle warehouse_request_items if it exists
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'warehouse_request_items') THEN
        ALTER TABLE warehouse_request_items DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        RAISE NOTICE '‚úÖ RLS disabled on warehouse_request_items';
    END IF;
END $$;

-- ==================== STEP 2: VERIFY IMMEDIATE ACCESS ====================

-- Test that all users can now access warehouse data
SELECT 
  '‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACCESS TEST' as test,
  'warehouses' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  'RLS DISABLED - SHOULD WORK FOR ALL USERS' as status
FROM warehouses;

SELECT 
  '‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACCESS TEST' as test,
  'warehouse_inventory' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  'RLS DISABLED - SHOULD WORK FOR ALL USERS' as status
FROM warehouse_inventory;

-- ==================== STEP 3: SHOW USER CONTEXT ====================

-- Show current user for debugging
SELECT 
  'üë§ CURRENT USER CONTEXT' as info,
  auth.uid() as current_user_id,
  up.email,
  up.name,
  up.role,
  up.status
FROM user_profiles up
WHERE up.id = auth.uid();

-- ==================== STEP 4: OPTION A - KEEP RLS DISABLED (QUICK FIX) ====================

-- If you want to keep RLS disabled for now (less secure but immediate fix):
SELECT 
  '‚ö†Ô∏è OPTION A: RLS DISABLED' as option,
  'All warehouse tables now accessible to all authenticated users' as description,
  'Less secure but immediate fix' as security_note,
  'Consider re-enabling RLS later with proper policies' as recommendation;

-- ==================== STEP 5: OPTION B - SIMPLE RLS POLICIES ====================

-- If you want to re-enable RLS with very simple policies:

-- Re-enable RLS
-- ALTER TABLE warehouses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE warehouse_inventory ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE warehouse_transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE warehouse_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create very simple policies (uncomment if you want to use this option)

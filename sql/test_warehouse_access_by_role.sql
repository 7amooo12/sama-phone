-- üß™ TEST WAREHOUSE ACCESS BY ROLE
-- Comprehensive testing script to verify access patterns for different user roles

-- ==================== STEP 1: IDENTIFY TEST USERS ====================

-- Show all users with their roles for testing
SELECT 
  'üë• AVAILABLE TEST USERS' as info,
  id,
  email,
  name,
  role,
  status,
  CASE 
    WHEN role IN ('admin', 'owner', 'accountant', 'warehouseManager') AND status = 'approved' 
    THEN '‚úÖ SHOULD HAVE ACCESS'
    ELSE '‚ùå NO ACCESS EXPECTED'
  END as expected_access
FROM user_profiles 
ORDER BY role, email;

-- ==================== STEP 2: TEST SPECIFIC USER ACCESS ====================

-- Test access for a specific admin user (replace with actual admin user ID)
-- Example: SELECT * FROM test_user_warehouse_access('ADMIN_USER_ID_HERE');

-- Test access for a specific owner user (replace with actual owner user ID)
-- Example: SELECT * FROM test_user_warehouse_access('OWNER_USER_ID_HERE');

-- Test access for a specific accountant user (replace with actual accountant user ID)
-- Example: SELECT * FROM test_user_warehouse_access('ACCOUNTANT_USER_ID_HERE');

-- Test access for a specific warehouse manager user (replace with actual warehouse manager user ID)
-- Example: SELECT * FROM test_user_warehouse_access('WAREHOUSE_MANAGER_USER_ID_HERE');

-- ==================== STEP 3: MANUAL ACCESS TESTS ====================

-- Test 1: Check if we can see warehouses (should work for all authorized roles)
SELECT 
  'üè¢ WAREHOUSES ACCESS TEST' as test_name,
  COUNT(*) as warehouse_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ ACCESS GRANTED'
    ELSE '‚ùå ACCESS DENIED'
  END as result

-- Test 2: Check if we can see warehouse inventory (should work for all authorized roles)
SELECT 
  'üì¶ WAREHOUSE INVENTORY ACCESS TEST' as test_name,
  COUNT(*) as inventory_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ ACCESS GRANTED'
    ELSE '‚ùå ACCESS DENIED OR NO DATA'
  END as result
FROM warehouse_inventory;

-- Test 3: Check if we can see warehouse transactions (should work for all authorized roles)
SELECT 
  'üìä WAREHOUSE TRANSACTIONS ACCESS TEST' as test_name,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ ACCESS GRANTED'
    ELSE '‚ùå ACCESS DENIED OR NO DATA'
  END as result
FROM warehouse_transactions;

-- Test 4: Check if we can see warehouse requests (should work for all authorized roles)
SELECT 
  'üìã WAREHOUSE REQUESTS ACCESS TEST' as test_name,
  COUNT(*) as request_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚úÖ ACCESS GRANTED'
    ELSE '‚ùå ACCESS DENIED OR NO DATA'
  END as result
FROM warehouse_requests;

-- ==================== STEP 4: DETAILED DATA INSPECTION ====================

-- Show sample warehouse data

  id,
  name,
  address,
  is_active,
  created_by,
  manager_id,

-- Show sample inventory data
SELECT 
  'üì¶ SAMPLE INVENTORY DATA' as info,
  wi.id,
  wi.warehouse_id,
  wi.product_id,
  wi.quantity,
  w.name as warehouse_name
FROM warehouse_inventory wi
LEFT JOIN warehouses w ON wi.warehouse_id = w.id
ORDER BY wi.last_updated DESC 
LIMIT 3;

-- Show sample transaction data
SELECT 
  'üìä SAMPLE TRANSACTION DATA' as info,
  wt.id,
  wt.warehouse_id,
  wt.product_id,
  wt.transaction_type,
  wt.quantity,
